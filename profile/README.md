# Dark Hours

Just when you think you've pulled off the perfect heist, your break-in is suddenly interrupted by an unexpected supernatural event. You find yourself trapped in the auction house you came to rob and you realize with horror that you are no longer alone... A demonic creature has taken over the place and you have become its new prey. Will you manage to escape? Will you survive this apocalyptic night?

## Gameplay

Remember, your first objective is to rob this place, so make sure to steal every valuable item you find. Score big. Carrying all that illegally-acquired loot can be tiring for your friends, so don't hesitate to discreetly offer your help by emptying their bags to steal the most precious items. There is no honor among thieves.

Don’t make too much noise or the monster will find you. Be careful: the more you loot, the louder you get. In case of extreme urgency, you can (sneakily) fill your teammates' bags so they are noisier than you.
